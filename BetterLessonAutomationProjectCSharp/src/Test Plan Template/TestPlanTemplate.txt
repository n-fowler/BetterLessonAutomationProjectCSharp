Using a test plan template is antiquated.  Most companies use cloud based test tracking software.
The goal is to automate your common regression testing and have it run with every build.
The test plans attached to these builds are seldom viewed once automated.
A properly written automated test has descriptive errors and commenting and doesn't require viewing the test plan.

Common tools I recommend are Zephyr, Microsoft Test Case Manager, or Test Rail.
Tests should follow a pattern of describing what you're trying to do and what the step result should be.
This should be fairly granular and steps should be simple.  No paragraphs if possible.

Small Example of how it looks (I'm most familiar with Microsoft Test Case Manager):
Step Number | Step Description                                                | Step Result                   | Status
1           | Enter Text "testfirst testlast" for Contact form name           | the text was entered          | PASS
2           | Enter Text "test@test.com" for Contact form email               | the text was entered          | PASS
3           | Enter Text "1-234-567-8901" for Contact form phone              | the text was entered          | PASS
4           | Enter Text "testsubject" for Contact form subject               | the text was entered          | PASS
5           | Enter Text "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,                         |                               |
            | consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt   |                               |
            | ut labore et dolore magna aliqua." for Contact form name        | the text was entered          | PASS
6           | Click "Submit"                                                  | the form was submitted        | PASS
            |                                                                 | {Success Data would be added} |                           |
